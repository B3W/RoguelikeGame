Rougelike Dungeon with Fog of War
  The purpose of this program is to procedurally generate randomized dungeon
  levels. This dungeon contains rooms, corridors, and monsters. Monsters have
  randomized attributes that consist of intelligence, telepathy, tunneling and
  erratic. Intelligent monsters use a shortest path to the player, telepathic
  monsters always know the location of the player, tunneling monsters are able
  to tunnel through rock, and erratic monsters have a chance of moving randomly.
  Monsters can have none, all, or some combination of these attributes. The
  player can progress through levels via the stairs located within the dungeon.

  Additional Features of the program:
    - Pathing via Dijkstra's Algorithm for intelligent creatures to find the player character
    - Status updates based on user input and dungeon events

  Key Mappings:
    7, y, KEY_HOME - Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper left
    8, k, KEY_UP - Attempt to move PC one cell up
    9, u, KEY_PPAGE - Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper right
    6, l, KEY_RIGHT - Attempt to move PC one cell right
    3, n, KEY_NPAGE - Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower right
    2, j, KEY_DOWN - Attempt to move PC one cell down
    1, b, KEY_END - Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower left
    4, h, KEY_LEFT - Attempt to move PC one cell left
    5, ., space, KEY_B2, - Rest for one turn
    
    > - Attempt to move down a staircase to the next dungeon level
    < - Attempt to move up a staircase to the next dungeon level
    
    m - Display the monster list (doesn't count as a PC turn)
      KEY_UP - Scroll monster list up when needed
      KEY_DOWN - Scroll monster list down when needed
      Escape, F1 - Close monster list and return to character control
    Q - Quit the game 

  Additional Key Mappings in CPP version:
    T - Display the tunneling distance map
    D - Display the non-tunneling distance map
    H - display hardness map
    s - Display the normal game dungeon
    f - toggle 'fog of war' on and off
    g - teleport player
      r - teleports player to random spot within the dungeon
      g - teleports player to spot denoted by '*'
      Normal movement keys for moving spot to teleport to
    
  Within the dungeon, meaning of currently diplayed characters is as follows:
    ' ' - Denotes rock
    '.' - Denotes room
    '#' - Denotes corridor
    '@' - Denotes player
    '<' - Denotes stair case going up
    '>' - Denotes stair case going down
    '*' - Location of  player when teleporting
    '0', '1', ... , 'e', 'f' - Denote monsters of various attributes

Implementation
  This implementation succeeds in meeting all of the required specifications.
  All code was ported over to C++ (i.e. structs to classes, gcc -> g++, etc.).
  The player carries a light with which they can see in a 3 tile x 3 tile radius.
  This feature is able to be toggled. The monster list and the nearest monsters
  indicator change behavior based on the status of the fog of war. Pressing 'g'
  will allow the player to teleport to any location within the dungeon.

NOTE
  If using PuTTY, navigate to Connection -> Data and make sure 'Terminal-type
  string' is putty. There has also been some weird keypad behavior when using PuTTY.
