Rougelike Dungeon with User Input
  The purpose of this program is to procedurally generate randomized dungeon
  levels. This dungeon contains rooms, corridors, and monsters. Monsters have
  randomized attributes that consist of intelligence, telepathy, tunneling and
  erratic. Intelligent monsters use a shortest path to the player, telepathic
  monsters always know the location of the player, tunneling monsters are able
  to tunnel through rock, and erratic monsters have a chance of moving randomly.
  Monsters can have none, all, or some combination of these attributes. The
  player can progress through levels via the stairs located within the dungeon.

  Additional Features of the progeam:
    - Pathing via Dijkstra's Algoritm for creatures to find the player character

  Within the dungeon, the meaning of currently diplayed characters is as follows:
    ' ' - Denotes rock
    '.' - Denotes room
    '#' - Denotes corridor
    '@' - Denotes player
    '<' - Denotes stair case going up
    '>' - Denotes stair case going down
    '0', '1', ... , 'e', 'f' - Denote monsters of various attributes
