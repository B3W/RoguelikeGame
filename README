Rougelike Dungeon with User Input
  The purpose of this program is to procedurally generate randomized dungeon
  levels. This dungeon contains rooms, corridors, and monsters. Monsters have
  randomized attributes that consist of intelligence, telepathy, tunneling and
  erratic. Intelligent monsters use a shortest path to the player, telepathic
  monsters always know the location of the player, tunneling monsters are able
  to tunnel through rock, and erratic monsters have a chance of moving randomly.
  Monsters can have none, all, or some combination of these attributes. The
  player can progress through levels via the stairs located within the dungeon.

  Additional Features of the progeam:
    - Pathing via Dijkstra's Algoritm for creatures to find the player character
    - Status updates based on user input

    9, u, KEY_PPAGE - Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper right
    6, l, KEY_RIGHT - Attempt to move PC one cell right
    3, n, KEY_NPAGE - Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower right
    2, j, KEY_DOWN - Attempt to move PC one cell down
    1, b, KEY_END - Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower left
    4, h, KEY_LEFT - Attempt to move PC one cell left
    5, ., space, KEY_B2, - Rest for one turn
    
    > - Attempt to move down a staircase to the next dungeon level

  Within the dungeon, meaning of currently diplayed characters is as follows:
    ' ' - Denotes rock
    '.' - Denotes room
    '#' - Denotes corridor
    '@' - Denotes player
    '<' - Denotes stair case going up
    '>' - Denotes stair case going down
    '0', '1', ... , 'e', 'f' - Denote monsters of various attributes

Implementation
  This implementation succeeds in meeting all of the required specifications.
  The user can now move around the PC and take staircases to new dungeons.
  Dungeons are not connected and each staircase taken will place the PC in
  a completely new dungeon. A new portion in main of rlg327.c handles the
  user input. check_move in move.c verifies PC movement. display_monster_list
  in rlg327.c does all of the work of showing the monster list. display_message
  in utils.c displays statuses above the dungeon.

NOTE
  If using PuTTY, navigate to Connection -> Data and make sure 'Terminal-type
  string' is putty. There has also been some weird keypad behavior with the
  keypad when using PuTTY.
