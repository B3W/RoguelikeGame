Rougelike Dungeon with User Input
  The purpose of this program is to procedurally generate a randomized dungeon
  levels. This dungeon will be utilized for displaying rooms, corridors, enemies,
  and items to the player (some of those things have yet to be implemented). The
  player can progress through levels via the stairs located within the dungeon.

  Additional Features of the progeam:
    - Pathing via Dijkstra's Algoritm for creatures to find the player character

  Within the dungeon, the meaning of currently diplayed characters is as follows:
    ' ' - Denotes rock
    '.' - Denotes room
    '#' - Denotes corridor
    '@' - Denotes player
    '0', '1', ... , 'e', 'f' - Denote monsters of various attributes

Implementation
  This implementation fell short of the specifications. There are serveral large
  bugs that I cannot pinpoint the cause of. I believe one is with the collision
  detection on the monsters. The other is with inserting the nodes back into the
  cue after using them. However, I'm not sure how to pinpoint that those are truly
  the sources of the bugs. Sometimes a few of the monsters will be able to make
  there way all the way to the PC and defeat him and then other times they will all
  just stop moving for seemingly no reason. I have already sank too much time into
  this assignment so it will be submitted with full knowledge of these bugs.
