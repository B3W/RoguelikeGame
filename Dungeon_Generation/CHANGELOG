	Fixed accidental forward slash on line 68
	Extended dungeon array to fit the status bar
	Changed init_dungeon function to init_dungeon_arr
	Changed room placing logic to only account for dungeon height

	Created render_corridors function for carving corridors between rooms
	Re-added -Werror flag to Makefile after finishing testing that required warnings to be allowed
	Updated README with character meanings and and updated implementation section

	Refactored by placing code in 'main' into a new function called 'init_dungeon'
	'init_dungeon' was created to abstract dungeon creation into a single call; this will be helpful in the future
	Added 'init_dungeon' to the header file
	Removed 'hardness' field from room struct as creating a single 2D array keeping track of hardness for each square in the dungeon makes more sense
	Added details to the @param annotations on some of  the functions where it was missing
	Changed enclosing brackets on functions to start on the line below the function declaration as I think it looks cleaner

	Added hardness functionality for rock in the dungeon
