Rougelike Dungeon Generation With Load/Save Ability
  The purpose of this program is to procedurally generate a randomized dungeon
  level. This dungeon will be utilized for displaying rooms, corridors, enemies,
  and items to the player (some of those things have yet to be implemented).

  The program also has the ability to load in a dungeon from disk or save a dungeon
  to disk for loading at a later time.

  Within the dungeon, the meaning of currently diplayed characters is as follows:
    ' ' - Denotes rock
    '.' - Denotes room
    '#' - Denotes corridor
    '@' - Denotes player

Implementation
  This implementation of the the load/save feature meets all specifications. Any
  dungeon created from another student's function program can be loaded from this
  program. This was tested with Jeremy's test dungeons. All test dungeons were
  successfully loaded regardless of the Endianess. Also, dungeons saved by this
  program can be loaded by any other student with functioning code.

  Lastly, if there is an attempt made to load a dungeon and the dungeon file does
  not exist then a new one will be generated.
