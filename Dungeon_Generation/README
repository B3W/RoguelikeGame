Rougelike Dungeon Generation
  The purpose of this program is to procedurally generate a randomized dungeon
  level. This dungeon will be utilized for displaying rooms, corridors, enemies,
  and items to the player (some of those things have yet to be implemented).

Implementation
  This implementation of the dungeon generation program meets all specifications.
  At least 5 rooms are randomly generated with x_size >= 3 and y_size >= 2 without
  touching or coming within one position of each other in any direction. The
  corridors are then attached to each room to allow for players to move in between
  them.

  init_rooms on line 84 does the heavy lifting for creating and error checking the
  rooms. Some of the settings have been generalized so altering the appearance of
  the dungeons will be possible if desired.
